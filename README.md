For Task 4 of my CodTech internship, I built a project called “Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning”. The goal was to create a simple but functional model that could predict whether an email is spam or not, using real-world data and the Scikit-learn library in Python. I started by exploring the dataset, which included several sample emails labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). Using Pandas, I loaded and inspected the data, cleaned it up, and prepared it for training. This included handling missing values, formatting the text, and organizing the labels. It was my first time working on a text classification problem from start to finish, and I was excited to see how machine learning could actually make such predictions with just words.

Next, I had to figure out how to turn the email text into numbers that a machine learning model could understand. I used TF-IDF Vectorization, which basically scores how important each word is in the context of the entire dataset. Then, I split the data into training and test sets and used the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm — which is commonly used for spam filtering — to train the model. After training, I tested the model's performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix, and the results were surprisingly good for a basic model. The classifier was able to identify spam emails based on common patterns in word usage, which was pretty fascinating to see in action.

This task was one of my favorite parts of the internship because it gave me real insight into how machine learning works in everyday tech — like filtering spam from your inbox. I learned how to take raw text data, clean it, convert it into a format a model can understand, and actually get useful predictions from it. It felt rewarding to apply all the small pieces I’ve been learning — like data wrangling, vectorization, and model evaluation — into one practical project. Overall, this task boosted my confidence in working with machine learning, especially for natural language tasks, and made me excited to explore more complex models in the future.
